# AI Agent Rules & Guidelines

Use tab indentation.

Write docs for the things we build. For key architecture decisions, write ADR docs to docs/adr.

## Commit Guidelines

- **Small, atomic commits** – Each commit does one logical thing and leaves the app in a working state.
- **Conventional commits** – Use `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:` etc. in the subject.
- **Imperative mood** – Subject line: "Add X" not "Added X".
- **Functional** – Every commit should build and run; avoid broken intermediate states.
